Hi there, I'm Niklas!

I'm full professor of Information Systems and human-centric AI at the University of Bayreuth. I am also department head at the Fraunhofer FIT, Senior Expert Aritifical Intelligence at IBM as well as an affiliated researcher at the KIT. In addition to my academic background, I have practical experience as a Managing Consultant Data Science at IBM. 

The focus of my research is on human-centric artificial intelligence. I strongly believe that two core competencies are necessary for inventive AI applications and their successful, fair and robust adaptation in the market: The technology perspective (deep knowledge of machine learning methods) and the human perspective (deep knowledge of human-centric design methods). 

Only in their interdisciplinary combination in the development of socio-technical systems can they unfold their full potential and provide benefits in later applications. It is also this interplay that reveals important research avenues that need to be further explored. For me, these currently include human-AI teamwork, appropriate trust in AI decisions, fairness in AI decision making, and environmental implications and benefits of AI. 

I see my mission in further exploring these principles and communicating them to students, industry, and society.
