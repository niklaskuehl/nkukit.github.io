Hi there, I'm Niklas!

The focus of my research is on human-centric artificial intelligence. I strongly believe that two core competencies are needed for innovative technologies and their successful adaptation in the market: The technology perspective (deep knowledge of machine learning methods) and the human perspective (deep knowledge of human-centric design methods). Only in their interdisciplinary combination in the development of socio-technical systems can they unfold their full potential and provide benefits in later applications. I see my mission in the further exploration of these principles and their teaching to students and society.
