Hi there, I'm Niklas!

I'm full professor of Information Systems and human-centric AI at the University of Bayreuth. I am also director at the Fraunhofer FIT and an affiliated researcher at the KIT. I have practical experience as a Managing Consultant Data Science at IBM. 

The focus of my research is on human-centric artificial intelligence. I strongly believe that two core competencies are needed for inventive AI applications and their successful, fair and robust adaptation in the market: The technology perspective (deep knowledge of machine learning methods) and the human perspective (deep knowledge of human-centric design methods). 

Only in their interdisciplinary combination in the development of socio-technical systems can they unfold their full potential and provide benefits in later applications. It is also this interplay with reveals important research avenues which need further exploration. To me these are currently, among others, the collaboration of human and AI in teams, the appropriate reliance in AI decisions, fairness in AI-assisted decision making as well as environmental implications and benefits of AI. 

I see my mission in the further exploration of these principles and their teaching to students, industry, and society.
